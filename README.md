### The Pros and Cons of using JavaScript libraries
In this course we are going to develop a singe page web app with native JavaScript. So no use of jQuery, React or other libraries and/or frameworks. We have to learn the actual underlying technologies, before learning abstractions. I have listed some pros and cons of using JavaScript libraries;

#### Pros
* Frameworks can provide you with a stable code base and a good set of features to begin with (but now we are going to learn those base in native JavaScript). [1]
* When your project needs to be accomplished quickly, a framework will be faster to set things up. [1]
* Most of the frameworks have a established community you can count on.  [1]
* There are some libraries that are offering something different, like D3.JS (a JavaScript library for visualizing data). [2]

#### Cons
* The number of libraries and frameworks available can be overwhelming. Vanilla JavaScript is making it much easier to choose. Plus, you only have to learn JavaScript instead of new basic principles of other libraries/frameworks.
* If your projects is a lightweight entity, you might just not even use the majority of the features and functions provided by the framework in question. Vanilla JavaScript is generally lightweight and quicker to operate as compared to frameworks.[1]
* You are independent of the updates and actions of the using framework.
* It doesn't mean that other colleagues are working with the same library/framework. For example, when you find a different company to work for it is possible that they using a different library than you are used to. You have to dive into another library again.
* Frameworks need to work for masses. Almost every product has something unique about it. And eventually there will at least be one such case that doesn't fit into the approach suggested by the framework. [3]


### The Pros and Cons of a single web app page
We are going to develop client side application.
In dit vak gaan we een single page web app ontwikkelen. Dit houdt in dat de gehele applicatie client side wordt afgehandeld (in de browser). Benoem voor- en nadelen van deze manier van applicaties ontwikkelen. Onderbouw je argumenten met online resources. Documenteer je bevindingen (met bronverwijzingen) in de README.md van de repository van dit vak.

#### Pros


#### Cons
